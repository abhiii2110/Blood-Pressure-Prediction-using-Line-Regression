Blood Pressure Prediction

Objective:
This dataset examines the relationship between age and blood pressure, focusing on the prediction accuracy of blood pressure values based on demographic information.

Dataset Composition:

Age: The age of individuals in the dataset. This independent variable helps to understand how age correlates with blood pressure.
Actual Blood Pressure: The recorded blood pressure measurement for each individual. This dependent variable represents the ground truth used to evaluate model predictions.
Predicted Blood Pressure: The blood pressure values estimated by a predictive model. This column is used to assess the modelâ€™s performance by comparing these predictions against actual measurements.
Scope:
The dataset includes a sample of individuals with their age, actual blood pressure readings, and corresponding predicted values. It is designed to analyze the effectiveness of predictive models in estimating blood pressure and to explore how well these models perform against real-world data.

Purpose:

Model Training: To develop and train machine learning models that predict blood pressure based on age and other potential features.
Performance Evaluation: To compare predicted blood pressure values with actual measurements to assess the accuracy and reliability of the prediction models.
Insight Generation: To explore how well age predicts blood pressure and to refine predictive algorithms for improved accuracy.
Data Considerations:

Ensure data accuracy and consistency in age, actual, and predicted blood pressure values.
Analyze model performance metrics to validate the effectiveness of predictions.
